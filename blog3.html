                <h3>
                    Testing our new PCB
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A few weeks ago I wrote about our <a href="https://www.campjobi.com/blog.html#Mar29" target="_blank"><em><u>custom printed circuit boards (PCB)</u></em></a> designed and manufactured by <a href="https://www.makerfabs.com/" target="_blank"><em><u>Makerfabs</u></em></a>. The first samples arrived, and I've started testing them. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The custom boards are a modification of Makerfabs's <a href="https://www.makerfabs.com/makepython-audio.html" target="_blank"><em><u>audio expansion board</u></em></a>. The modified PBC includes a jack for power into USB-c that will power all the LEDs; a <a href="https://electricfiredesign.com/2021/03/12/logic-level-shifters-for-driving-led-strips/" target="_blank"><em><u>level shifter chip</u></em></a>.; and an amplifier (the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3006" target="_blank"><em><u>MAX98357A</u></em></a>). It also includes an output jack for data and power to the LEDs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First I put the board on the multimeter and the osilloscope (see photo). The multimeter confirms that the board is passing power directly from the battery through USB-c to the +5v/GND leads to power the LEDs. This is good, the same voltage from the battery is coming across the cable to the LEDs, no voltage drop, so there's a clean power plane in the PCB. 
                </p>
             
                <p>
                    <img src="April19/IMG_2541.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I put the data lead thru the oscilloscope to check that the level shifter is doing its job: if the level shifter weren't working, we'd see the peaks of the data high signal at 3.3v, which is the voltage that comes out of the ESP32. However, we correctly see a nice steady 5v for high (ok there's a little bounce, don't worry about that, the ESP32 isn't all that crisp at 1MHz). Check: we don't need to worry about the <a href="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf" target="_blank"><em><u>WS2812b</u></em></a> chips in the LEDs losing track of the signal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that the oscope shows that data is flowing at about 1MHz. That's just about right for the WS2812b's max 800kbs. So I think that's good too. Great stuff: next up is a test of the wifi and how the boards coordinate with the server software we're developing.

                    Testing flower communication 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The flowers talk to each other and to a server over wifi. We need to start testing how well the wifi works, and to look for bugs in our communications software. So we assembled a few test flowers with the new custom PCBs and Makerfabs's ESP-32, along with a speaker and LEDs in prototype flowers (and LED loops to simulate the leaves).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="April20/IMG_2545.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next I moved the flowers out 50', 75', and 100' from the router. 
                </p>
             
                <p>
                    <img src="April20/FoF-distance-test-20230416.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point is to measure the wifi signal strength and make sure we can tell the flowers to do stuff from the server. I've got my <a href="https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat" target="_blank"><em><u>shop server</u></em></a> running NTP and <a href="https://mosquitto.org/" target="_blank"><em><u>mosquitto</u></em></a>. (which was slightly more trouble than I expected bc <a href="https://www.apparmor.net/" target="_blank"><em><u> security I didn't know my vender included</u></em></a> kept blocking them). Here's what the <a href="https://github.com/vm-wylbur-pi/fof_tests/tree/main/flower_control_center" target="_blank"><em><u>flower-control-center</u></em></a> looks like (omg I ❤❤❤ the flower control center!):
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="April20/flower-control-distance-test-20230416.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signal strength drops with distance, of course: 50' is totally fine (-45dbm), 75' is weak (-64dbm), and 100' is marginal (-75dbm). I moved the flowers around some, and this result is consistent. While I say "marginal," I was able to send a "playAudio" command to the farthest flower with no trouble (the cheapie bluetooth speakers are *plenty* loud, we're going to have to figure out how to configure them to standard volume on the speaker side). However, I note that the signal that far out is only -75dbm, and we could have dropouts for the flowers far side of the garden on the far side of the router.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we're worried about signal strength (maybe?), I wonder if we want to put a "beehive" or something in the middle of the field for the router? That would mean a max of ~50' from router to all the flowers, thereby keeping all the flowers at good signal strength? The downside would be that we'd probably want to trench from the flagpole/bird/camera to the router to run an ethernet cable so we get zero dropouts between RPi controller+camera and the router. Anyway, that's a design problem we will keep thinking about.

                <p>
                    In a previous post <a href="blog.html#Apr11" target="_blank"><em><u>("Stems and Caps")</u></em></a>, I wrote about how we're creating the stalks of the flowers by bending the PVC. Here I want to provide a little more detail. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We heat sand in an oven at 550F. Then we pour the hot sand into PVC pipes. When the pipes get hot, they get all floppy and we can push them into forms. 
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we pour out the hot sand and let the pipes cool for about 30 minutes. 
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    It makes a mess, but the results are terrific! We have 170 stalks with pretty bends ready for sanding, painting, drilling, and then assembly with flowers, leaves, and the birdhouse (a blogpost on on birdhouses coming soon).

                    Painting is a little tricky. The primer clogged the sprayer, so (after much discussion with the sprayer manufacturer's tech support) we gave up and primed by hand. The final coats are still in progress. 
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile we cut the bases which are pine 1x8 ripped to 3.5", cut to 8.25", with a hole drilled for the stalk to pass through. 
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The bases hold a little box that will protect the PCBs, the batteries, and the speakers; we call this box the birdhouse. The sides of the birdhouse are the most complicated part. We cut 4'x8' sheets of plywood into 8.25" strips, then cut four 1/4" dadoes into them, then chopped them to 9", then routed a rabbet across the top so that the tops will seat smoothly into them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="May4/WoodStack.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    This step had a lot of mistakes. The plywood doesn't really like to have so many grooves cut into it, so about 40% of the panels splintered and must be discarded; I remade them all yesterday. Cutting so much into the plywood maybe wasn't my best design decision. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we have to cut holes into all the panels so the speaker's sound will come out. I'm calling this the festival of template routing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we started cutting 1/8" Lauan strips for the internal dividers. These 4x8' sheets are too floppy and thin to cut on the table saw, so we set up a straight edge and cut the strips with a circular saw (with a finely-toothed blade). They turned out better than I expected. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="May4/planing.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it's all going! We have tons more little tasks getting done, and I can really feel the momentum now. Very exciting!

                    A golden deluge of morning sunlight poured into the valley, casting an amber glow across many
rocky outcroppings while throwing myriad recesses into deep, umber shadows. The final exertions of
winter’s frigid gifts rested lightly along the slopes, yet the landscape had already begun to experience
the exuberant quickening of spring. Near a weather-worn rock face, emerging from a snug burrow after
having patiently overwintered therein, a tiny creature gingerly ventured forth. Vibrant yellow collided
beautifully with stripes of jet, glossy and robust, existing in stark contrast to the muted environment
surrounding its burrow. Antennae lazily danced while six legs, long ago addled by freezing temperatures,
regained their strength. Gossamer wings began the long process of engorging, fueled by the glycol-rich
blood coursing through her body. She is able to rouse herself much earlier than her fellow pollinators
due to her wonderfully adapted physiology and, as such, has her pick of the most delectable blossoms of
early spring here in Nevada…

                    The Nevada bumblebee is a species of flying insect that ranges across much of western North
                    America. Like many bumblebees across the globe, she enjoys early spring feeding due to the presence of
                    increased levels of glycol in her blood. This chemical allows bumblebees to overwinter without freezing.
                    Bumblebees are covered in hairy structures called ‘setae’ that give them their iconic furry appearance
                    and lend to the erroneous belief that bumblebees should not be able to fly. Bumblebees are responsible
                    for the pollination of many native plant species, as well as major crop resources including but not limited
                    to tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. Bumblebees are becoming ever more popular both within and
                    without professional greenhouse operations due to their special relationship with these important food
                    sources.

                    Pollinating powerhouses. In armour of cerulean majesty clad. Metallic and resplendent but
                    somehow simultaneously understated. Meticulous, methodical, and driven to a degree of devotedness
                    perhaps unmatched by us mere hominids. These are a small selection of words that may communicate
                    the sense of absolute wonder that you may well experience when first you witness these pollinating
                    perfectionists in action. Each of these sapphire super-soldiers dominates the botanical battlespace,
                    visiting and pollinating each delicate blossom in her chosen orchard with the dedication and tenacity of
                    a born flower hunter. Irascibility is not her nature, but she attacks the bepetalled target quickly and
                    efficiently before moving on in short order. Time is of the essence, and the survival of her brood rests on
                    her dedicated pursuit of her singular objective.

                    Blue orchard mason bees are my favorite species of bee. Yes, you heard me correctly, I have a
favorite species of pollinating insect. I’m just that type of bug nerd, you see? Please don’t tell the other
pollinators, though, as a personal courtesy.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Mason bees require a very small space in which to nest and reproduce. This provides you, the
reader, with an amazing opportunity to support the natural propagation of this species by being, for lack
of a better term…lazy. Reeds, old sticks, and bamboo make perfect nesting sites for these hard-working
single moms. We can support the reproductive habits of this species by allowing a certain amount of
clutter in our personal space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I fully understand if you’re completely amazed and enamoured with these iridescent wonders.
Wait, though, there’s more! In addition to being easy to maintain in their natural environment, blue
orchard mason bees are also incredibly useful in greenhouse growing operations. Their preferred
nesting sites are a fraction of the size compared to those of European honey bees. Moreover, blue
orchard mason bees are often more efficient pollinators when compared to honey bees due to
differences in their feeding habits. Once the bundles of tubes have been reloaded with pollen and eggs,
these nests can be stored and safely maintained in the crisper of a refrigerator until the follow spring.
Portable, efficient, and beautiful. What more could we ask for in a single pollinating insect?

                    Insects buzzed circuitously around a leafy shrub, tiny flecks of emerald green superimposed
                    against an equally verdant background. Dozens of males patrolled the white and ruddy blooms of this
                    most fortunate of shrubs, the beautiful and biblical Rose of Sharon. Though their behavior would
                    suggest an inclination towards the lackadaisical, the flight of these males belied their true purpose in
                    patrolling this plant. Sometime soon, an equally magnificent and unelated female of their species would
                    happen by, drawn in by the sweet scent of nectar wafting on the gentle breeze. The fortuitous arrival of
                    such a female nuptial candidate will begin a wonderous waltz of irresistible attraction, during which
                    future generation of green sweat bees will be assured.

perhaps most perfectly to our purposes, “flowers of the field”.

                    Green sweat bees can be found across the Western hemisphere. Unlike their relatives, green
sweat bees are comparatively uninterested in the salty sweat of humans. This if, of course, excellent
news for those of you who experience any degree of entomophobia. Green sweat bees aren’t even truly
social as a species, rather being classified as communal insects. Elated females may share a burrow
entrance with many other reproductive female green sweat bees, but they each construct their own
nesting burrows within this communal space. Furthermore, they harvest their own pollen and nectar as
food for their personal offspring. This individualistic yet communal living approach to life and
reproduction provides an excellent defense mechanism against kleptoparasitic bee species with which
they share their environs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Green sweat bees of the A. texanus variety are pollinating specialists. If you’ve worn a cotton
garment recently, you might consider thanking this particular green sweat bee for her very work in
making your personal brand of adornment possible. In addition to this textile-based superpower, green
sweat bees can even replace certain pollinating functions of traditional European honey bees.

                    Playa happens.

                <p>
                    Like most well-told tales, the best playa stories start with a whimsical hook meant to engender
interest and attentiveness amongst the chosen audience. Many veteran burners can pontificate at great
length about the time their tent became an impromptu balloon and flew, cracking and cackling like
Babayaga in her cauldron towards the Black Rock. Your storyteller may instead choose to describe that
one very specific instance where the nighttime temperatures dipped so low as to create beautiful
fractals in their water source in a scene somewhat more reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic thriller flick
than an actual occurrence. Remember, though, that all playa stories are true…from the right point of
view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="May24/0-1.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">

                <p>
                    We slogged through the soft putty that was Black Rock Desert in early May. Each laborious step
was accompanied by a sad, slurping sound that seemed to both mock and mourn our now-destroyed
footwear. Nearby, several sets of tire tracks evidenced repeated and truly comical attempts to ford the
sticky morass. Had these errant motorists escaped with their lives and dignity intact?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="May24/0-3.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    At a distance that seemed like leagues from the muddy shoe that marked the center reference
point of our endeavor, we planted our stakes and began our field test. A test space took shape,
delineated by glow sticks and lag bolts that we had perhaps laughingly “drilled” into the surface of playa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The field, some 100 feet squared, provided a representative space with which we could test the
                    power and resolution provided by the trio of infrared flood lights that had been placed quite expertly on
                    the roof of a blessedly unmired RV. Our camera specialist and technological mastermind, George, had
                    bravely positioned himself atop this steel redoubt above the muck, shouting orders and corrections to
                    his minions below over the gusting winds of a region that still believed itself in the clutches of a most
                    confusing winter. Children and adults alike capered within the sodden test field as if on the strings of a
                    mad puppeteer as the IR floods were moved to various positions. All while the rain, and our hopes of
                    ever feeling solid ground once more, fell…
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="May24/0-4.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our field test, as you now understand, ran afoul of some odd weather in northern Washoe
County in the great state of Nevada. We were, however, able to collect some excellent information
during our test cycle, both during the day and at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="May24/0-5.webp" class="card-img-top" alt="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, the winter-marred surface of playa created a number of images within the recognition
software that are remarkably similar to human faces. These confounding visages appeared both in the
original test footage that was collected on Treasure Island and in the second set of test images collected
on-site while aboard Black Rock Desert. This information is very useful as it will allow George to set the

fidelity levels of the software more accurately in order to better service our needs for veritable
identification of human participants during Burning Man 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, were learned that playa is somewhat reflective under IR illumination. During the later
stages of this field rest, the prevailing winds had created a crusty surface of playa dust, like icing atop
frosting. We intend to repeat our field test in late June, during which time we hope to determine just
how reflective the fully dried surface of playa is and, if need be, by which methods we can cancel these
reflective properties as they interact with our software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, we positively confirmed that three IR floods will not be enough to properly illuminate our
area of interactivity. In order to fully illuminate our dusty flower garden, we estimate that a total of six
IR floods of similar power level as the originals will be required. Not only will this provide for a more
significant level of illumination with which the camera and software may work, but we will be able to
expand the perceptive perimeter of the Field of Flowers to allow for advance tracking of any participants
before they reach the edge of the flowers themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this initial test was a huge success and provides a bevy of new information with which
we can continue to refine and expand the future capabilities of this art project, the Field of Flowers.
